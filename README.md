# Anki 2.1 add-on: Chinese Words Finder

This add-on finds all Chinese characters (traditional and simplified) in your collection and creates all possible two syllable words that can be made using those characters. 
<br>After that, it checks which of these words are actual Chinese words by using the CC-CEDICT dictionary and creates a text file containing
all the words that it found, pinyin and the English definition. This file can be imported into Anki.

This is the first add-on that I wrote. I don't have a lot of programming experiences, so I would appreciate your feedback and suggestions on
how I can improve it.
