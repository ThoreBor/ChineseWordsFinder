# Anki 2.1 add-on: Chinese Words Finder

This add-on finds all Chinese words in the CC-CEDICT dictionary that only use the characters in the decks you select and creates a text file with the words, pinyin and English translations that can be imported into Anki.
Start the add-on by clicking on CWF>Chinese Words Finder.
Since V1.4 you can also search for missing HSK words and analyse the frequency of characters.

This is the first add-on that I wrote. I don't have a lot of programming experiences, so I would appreciate your feedback and suggestions on
how I can improve it.
