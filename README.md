# Anki 2.1 add-on: Chinese Words Finder

This add-on finds all Chinese words in the CC-CEDICT dictionary that only use the characters in your collection and creates a text file with the words, pinyin and English translation that can be imported into Anki.
Start the add-on by clicking on Tools>Chinese Words Finder.

With this update it should only take a couple of seconds to find all words. I also added a config.json file.

This is the first add-on that I wrote. I don't have a lot of programming experiences, so I would appreciate your feedback and suggestions on
how I can improve it.
