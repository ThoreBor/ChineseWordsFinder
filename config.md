<b>Everything but the HSK configurations will effect the 'Chinese Words Finder' results. Only the HSK, field_number and deckname configurations will effect the 'Missing HSK words' results. Only the deckname and field_number configurations will effect the 'Character frequency results'. </b><br><br>
Change the HSK level to the one you want (1-6). The level you pick inludes all previous levels.<br><br>
Replace "Default" with the deck you want to analyse. If you want to analyse more than one deck, write the name of the deck in the next line seperated by a comma. <br><br>
If you only want to analyse the content of a specific field, change field_number to the field of your choosing. 0 means that all fields will be analysed. <b>You need to set it to a specific field if you want to use the "Missing HSK words" tool.</b><br></br><br>
If you change filter_active to True, entries that contain words from the "filter" won't show up in the results. You can change and add words to the filter.<br><br>
Single character words are ignored by default. If you want to include them change min_length to 1, change it to 3 to ignore two character words etc. If you want to set a maxium length for words, change max_length to something other than 0. 0 means that there's no limit.<br><br>
Change the 1 to 0, if you use traditional characters.
