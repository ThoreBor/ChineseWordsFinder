Replace "Default" with the deck you want to analyse. If you want to analyse more than one deck, write the name of the deck in the next line seperated by a comma. <br><br>
If you change filter_active to True, entries that contain words from the "filter" won't show up in the results. You can change and add words to the filter.<br><br>
Single character words are ignored by default. If you want to include them change min_length to 1, change it to two to ignore two character words etc. If you want to set a maxium length for the words, change max_length to something other than 0. 0 means that there's no limit.<br><br>
Change the 1 to 0, if you use traditional characters. <br><br>
<b>You may have to restart Anki for the changes to be effective.</b>
